# Introduction to Fortran 

This is a hand-on introduction to the Fortran programming language. This course will be useful for scientists and engineers who want to move away fom Fortran 77 or who want to build applications handling mathematical constructs such as matrices. We will learn the synthax of Fortran 90/95 language, how to write Fortran programs, compile them and run them.

### Prerequisites
