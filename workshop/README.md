# Fortran Workshop 

Fortran is a computer programming language that is extensively used in numerical, scientific computing. It has a strong user base with scientific programmers, and is used in organisations such as weather forecasters, financial trading, and in engineering simulations. Fortran programs can be highly optimised to run on high performance computers, and in general the language is suited to producing code where performance is important.

Fortran is a compiled language, or more specifically it is compiled ahead-of-time. In other words, you must perform a special step called compilation of your written code before you are able to run it on a computer. This is where Fortran differs to interpreted languages such as Python and R which run through an interpreter which executes the instructions directly, but at the cost of compute speed.

In this two-day workshop, we will introduce the main concepts of the Fortran programming language. We will learn how to write simple Fortran programs and as we introduce more advanced concepts (module, derived types, object oriented programming), we will design and write a complex application. Thoughout this workshop, we will have had-on exercises to reinforce what is presented.

### Target Audience
This workshop will be useful for scientists and engineers who want to start programming in Fortran and also desire to learn Fortran advanced features.

### Prerequisites
Familiarity with computer programming, and if possible any compiled language.

### Expected Outcomes
After this workshop, partcipants will be able to:
- Understand 
    - Fortran data types
    - How to perform arithmetic operations
    - How to write conditional statements, loops
    - How to write subroutines, functions and modules
    - Derived types and how to use them
    - Manipulate data array
    - How object oriented programming concepts are implemented in Fortran
    - The different components of a Fortran programs
- Write a Fortran application (including functions/subroutines, modules, complex data structures) from scratch
- Read/Write files
- Compile and run the application.
- Understand how to write a Makefile file needed to compile a Fortran application.

## Teaching Tool and Platform

All the materials are written in Jupyter notebook files to facilate accessibility, readibility and maintainability. Whenever necessary, we may write and execute simple Fortran programs directy from Jupyter notebook cells. Most the times, we will use command line to write, compile and execute Fortran programs.

If you are not familiar yet, we recommend that you learn the basic `vi` commands. 
You can start with the following tutorial: [Vi Text Editor!](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/vi.php).
